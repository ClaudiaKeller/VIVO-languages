German VIVO language project 
============================

Files that enable VIVO (supported by Vitro) to operate in German.

The repository is structured this way
* Each top-level directory represents a different release of VIVO.
* Within these, each Second-level directory contains files for a specific langauge, for that release. 
These directories are named for the "locale" of the language and region that they represent.

For example, a directory of files for the German language (de), as used in Germany (DE), for VIVO release 1.6:

    /vivo-1.6/de_DE/

Using the language files
------------------------

If the files you want already exist here, you can add them to your VIVO instance by
following the instructions in the VIVO wiki for [Adding a language to VIVO][1].

If the files for your desired language do not exist, then you may use this example as a 
starting point for doing the translations yourself. Please send a note to [the developer's list][2],
or directly to the [VIVO release manager][3], to find out if someone else is already working
on a translation.

If you create a translation, please consider contributing your language files to the VIVO community.
